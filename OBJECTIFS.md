# Objectives for the EcoBlock Project

This document outlines the primary goals of the **EcoBlock Project**, with detailed steps to accomplish them and track progress. The ultimate aim is to create a decentralized network leveraging a Tangle structure, built using Flutter and Rust.

---

## **Main Goal: Build a Decentralized Network with a Tangle**

### Objectives and Detailed Steps:

---

### **1. Initial Setup**

- [x] **Create the project structure:**
  - Use `flutter_rust_bridge` to integrate Rust into a Flutter app.
  - Set up the `ecoblock_server` Rust module and generate bindings.
  - Validate the setup by running a basic function (`greet`) from Rust in Flutter.

- [x] **Define the project architecture:**
  - Backend in Rust for logic and networking.
  - Frontend in Flutter for the user interface.
  - A bridge for seamless communication between the two.

---

### **2. Backend Development (Rust)**

#### **Step 1: Node Management**
- [ ] **Add and manage nodes in the decentralized network:**
  - [ ] Function to add a node (`add_node`).
  - [ ] Function to remove a node (`remove_node`).
  - [ ] Function to list all connected nodes (`list_nodes`).

#### **Step 2: Peer-to-Peer Communication**
- [ ] **Enable basic communication between nodes:**
  - [ ] Function to send messages to a specific node.
  - [ ] Function to receive messages.

#### **Step 3: Data Synchronization**
- [ ] **Implement data exchange protocols:**
  - [ ] Establish protocols for syncing data between nodes.
  - [ ] Ensure data consistency and prevent duplication.

#### **Step 4: Tangle Implementation**
- [ ] **Build the Tangle structure:**
  - [ ] Define the data structure for Tangle (DAG).
  - [ ] Add support for nodes to add transactions to the Tangle.
  - [ ] Implement transaction confirmation based on Tangle rules.

---

### **3. Frontend Development (Flutter)**

#### **Step 1: User Interface for Node Management**
- [ ] **Design screens to manage nodes:**
  - [ ] Home screen showing the list of connected nodes.
  - [ ] Interface to add or remove nodes.

#### **Step 2: Visualizing the Tangle**
- [ ] **Create a visualization of the Tangle structure:**
  - [ ] Display nodes and their connections in a graph-like format.
  - [ ] Highlight active and inactive nodes.

#### **Step 3: Messaging Interface**
- [ ] **Enable user-to-node messaging:**
  - [ ] UI for sending messages to specific nodes.
  - [ ] Display incoming messages.

---

### **4. Testing and Optimization**

- [ ] **Unit tests for backend functions:**
  - [ ] Test `add_node`, `remove_node`, and `list_nodes`.
  - [ ] Validate message exchange between nodes.

- [ ] **End-to-end testing:**
  - [ ] Simulate a network of nodes to test the Tangle.
  - [ ] Optimize performance for large-scale networks.

---

### **5. Documentation and Open Source**

#### **Step 1: Write Comprehensive Documentation**
- [ ] **Provide clear instructions for developers:**
  - [ ] How to set up the project locally.
  - [ ] Explanation of the Tangle structure and implementation.

#### **Step 2: Publish as Open Source**
- [ ] **Prepare the project for public contribution:**
  - [ ] Add a `README.md` with an overview and setup guide.
  - [ ] Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on contributing.
  - [ ] Publish on GitHub with proper tags and a license.

## **Progress Overview**

### **Completed Tasks:**
- Initial setup of project structure.
- Basic integration of Flutter and Rust using `flutter_rust_bridge`.

### **In Progress:**
- Development of backend functions for node management.

### **Next Steps:**
1. Implement `add_node` and `list_nodes` functions in Rust.
2. Create a basic UI in Flutter to interact with these functions.
3. Begin working on peer-to-peer communication.

---

## **Long-Term Vision**
1. Fully operational decentralized network using a Tangle.
2. Scalability to support a large number of nodes.
3. Open-source ecosystem enabling community-driven improvements.
